				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>I bring over 10 years of successful experience in retail management, where I led teams, drove performance, and developed future leaders. I am now actively transitioning into a lifelong goal of pursuing a career in computer science. With a strong passion for technology and problem-solving, I’m excited to apply my leadership background to the world of programming—where I enjoy developing creative and innovative solutions through code.
				<br><br><br>
				I am currently in my senior year pursuing a degree in Computer Science, having completed coursework in computer logic, computer organization, systems software, data structures, and object-oriented programming. I am enthusiastic about exploring opportunities in fields such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, data Science, software development and cybersecurity.
